# StockInfoVBA
In this project I used VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
I had to utilize some 'for loops' to run through the one year of stock data. 

The 'for loop' read/stored all of the following values from each row: 
ticker symbol ,
volume of stock ,
open price and
close price 

Condiitonal formatting was appiled to highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. 
The VBA script ran for all three calender years of 2018, 2019 and 2020.
